robot-coordination-space
========================

Generates a coordination space for n robots with n static obstacles residing in a 2D plane.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Takes as input the obstacle and policy files from a working trajectory given by the [MSL Library](http://msl.cs.uiuc.edu/msl/).
* Generates an n-dimensional coordination space indicating which areas can result in a collision.
* Also provides ability to:
--* Plot 2D robot trajectories
--* Plot 2D and 3D coordination space

### How do I get set up? ###

* Requires the obstacle and trajectory files generated by the MSL Library
    * Obstacle file must have no newlines after the last set of obstacle points
* Dependencies
    * Python 2.7.6
    * matplotlib 1.4.0
